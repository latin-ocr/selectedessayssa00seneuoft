AD POLYBIUM DE CONSOLATIONE 105

having read the work, may have referred to it inaccurately from
his general impression of what he had heard of it. So, easily,
the plural “ freedmen’' might be accounted for, and Messalina
was a natural inference. Possibly the lost beginning of the piece
included some references to her and them; and indeed Seneca’s
effort to suppress the work may have been so far successful as
to be the cause of the fact that it has been transmitted to us only
in a mutilated form.

The extent of the loss at the beginning of the dialogue we do
not know. The traditional paragraph numbers are no guide; for
in many of the manuscripts and in the early editions this Con-
solatio follows without separation after the dialogue Ad Paulinum
de Brevitate Vitae, and the number-ing is consecutive, the first
few sentences of the Consolatio ad Polybium being treated as a
remainder of the twentieth chapter of the De Brevitate V itae. In
the present‘text the old numbers are given in Arabio figures in
brackets.

It is an interesting fact that in the best manuscript of the
Twelve Dialoyues, the Codex Ambrosianus C 90 (written about
the beginning of the eleventh century), of the Ambrosian library
in Milan, the Consolatio ad Polybium is nearly all lacking. It was
originally included in this manuscript, as is shown hythe index
prefixed to the folio which contains the dialogues‚ and by the fact
that about a page and a half of it, from the words moyna dis-
crimina (chap. xvii. 2) to the end, are still there. The rest of the
leaves which contained the work have been torn out, we may
guess, by some monkish critic whose disapproval of Seneca's
flatteries was so violent that it had to be expressed in this way.
The first part of the dialogue was doubtless lost before this manu-
script was made. For the greater part of the existing text of it
we have to rely upon a group of later manuscripts, of which the
best is one at Berlin, of the fourteenth century.

Helviam Illam-em, or the retrospective enthusiasm for the retirement
and uninterrupted philosophie speculation of his life in Corsica which
is put into his mouth in the Octavia, lines 381 seq. Yet it is by no
means inconceivable that the Consolation to Helvia may itself have been
published with some view to its effect upon Seneca’s fortunes‚ though
it represents a totally different pose from that exhibited to Polybius.
