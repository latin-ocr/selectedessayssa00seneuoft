AD POLYBIUM DE CONSOLATIONE

Pomanus, whose brother's death was the occasion of Seneca's
proffered consolation, was a freedman of the Emperor Claudius,
and occupied the important post of ab studiis‚¹ — secretary to the
Emperor in his literary work. Apparently also from a remark
in the present Consolatio, vi. 5, he performed at least to some
extent the duties of secretary a libellis, who received and classified
the petitions addressed to the Emperor. That Polybius did liter—
ary work on his own account is evident from chapters ii.,viii., and
xi. From the Consolatio, too, we know that he had other brothers
besides the one whom he had lost, and also a wife and son.² Ac-
cording to Dio Cassius‚³ Polybius intrigued with the Empress
Messalina, who finally turned against him and caused his death;
to this connection Seneca seems to allude in the A pocolocyntosis,
xiii. 5.

The Consolation to Polybius was written from Corsica after
Seneca had been in exile there for about two years, when he was
losing the fine patience that he had displayed in comforting his
mother Helvia upon his misfortune. He‘offers to Polybius hon-
estly enough the common consolations of his philosophie repertory;
but the most notable feature of the essay is the flattery of the
Emperor, which presently appears to have been its chief motive,
in the hope, on Seneca's part, that it would be reported to Claudius
and lead to his own pardon and return from exile. For the time,
at least, the hope proved vain.

The question,⁴ by Diderot and others, of the authenticity of this
work as Seneca's, was chiefly on ‘the ground of its general un-
worthiness of Seneca’s character, and particularly of the absurd
