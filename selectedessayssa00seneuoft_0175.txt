of Misrule.’' Claudius's love of feasting was notorious (Suet.
clm—33). Perhaps, also, since in the Saturnalia slaves were
temporarily on an equality with their masters, here is an allusion
to the influential position of Claudius’s freedmen. When Nar-
* cissus went to make a speech to the mutinous soldiers of A. Plau-
tius (Dio. Lx. 19), they shoutoa Quaen-„Ch xii. 2;

a striking paralleL—non tulisset illud: he wouldn’t have 9οί it.—
quantum . . . in illo fuit: so sar as in him lay—damnavit in-
cesti: by implieation, for Jove was guilty of what Silanus was
charged with; ef. Verg. Aen. I. 46, Iovis et soror et coniunx.—
generum suum: L. Junius Silanus Torquatus was betrothed (not
married) to Claudius's daughter Octavia. When Agrippina
wished Nero to marry Octavia, Silanus was aeeused of incest by

“I say!'’ Athenis: Cimon’s marriage with Elpinice is the fa-
miliar example of marriages with a half-sister.—Alexandriae: as
in the marriages of the Ptolemies.

crities are far from agreement. It is evidently a defence of Clau-
dius, and perhaps means that at Rome both inice and men are so
finieally careful that Claudius had to apply a striet standard. —
