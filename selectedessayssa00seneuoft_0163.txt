APOCOLOCYNTOSIS

Tum Menippean satire¹ on the apotheosis of Claudius is found
in most of its manuscripts and in the early editions under the not
very exact title, Ludus de M orte Claudii Caesaris. In the best
manuscript, that 0f Saint Gall (Codex sangallensis, 569), it is
called Divi Claudii Apotheosis Annaei Senecae per saturam. The
title by which it is now generally known,we owe to an allusion by
the Greek historian, Dio Cassius.

Dio says (LX.· 35): “After Claudius's murder, Agrippina
and Nero pretended to mourn, and sent up to heaven him
whom they had carried out from dinner. This was the occasion
of a very elever witticism by L. Junius Gallio, Seneea’s brother.
Seneca had composed a piece named Ἀποκολοκύντωσις after the
analogy of ἀπαθανάτισις, but his brother expressed a great deal in
a very few words. Recalling how the bodies of those who are
executed 111 prison are dragged off by the exeoutioners, with
great hooks, to the Forum and thence to the river, he said
Claudius had been dragged up to heaven with a hook. Nero’s
joke‚² too, is worth reeording. He said that mushrooms (μύκητες,
boleti) must be food for the gods, since by eating them Claudius
was made a god.’'

The burlesque word Apocolocyntosis, on the analogy of “apothe-
osis,¹' may be likened to “pumpkinification'' on that of “deifica-
tion.'’ The κολοκύντη (Latin, cucurbita) was a species of gourd
which seems to have stood for a type and symbol of stupidity
among the ancients, as the cabbage head³ is with us. The fact
that in the satire as we have it there is no question of turning
Claudius into such a vegetabie, is an evident difficulty in identify-
ing this piece with the one mentioned by Dio; and a few critics
