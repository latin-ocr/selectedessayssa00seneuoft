THE sTom PHILosOPHY xvii

its natural opposite, the school of the Epicureans, dealt
more with the practical questions of moral philosophy
than with the speculative inquiries of the Platonists and
the Peripatetics. This difference of aim, to which the
difference of national temperament reacted, made the
