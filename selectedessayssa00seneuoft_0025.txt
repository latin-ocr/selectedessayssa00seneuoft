sENEoA’s WORKs xxi

the Hercules Furens, the Troades, and the Phaedra, are
generally accepted as Seneca's. With them is a tenth,
the praetexta entitled Octavia, which Seneca almost cer-
tainly did not write; it.is founded upon contemporary
history and he himself is a character in it}

A considerable part of Seneca’s works is lost, portions
of those which we have and others entirely, to which
allusions are made either in his own extant writings or by
other authors. Among the more interesting of them ap-
pear to have been the De Situ et Sacris Aqusptiorum, which
was one of the fruits of a temporary residence in Egypt
during his early life, the Dc Forma M ancli, in which, ac-
cording to a reference in Boethius, there is stated a theory of
the spherical shape of the earth, and the Dialoqus de Super-
stitione, to which St. Augustine alludes in his De Civitate

, Dei (VI. 10), besides several other moral essays. Seneca
’ also wrote a biography of his father, and various published
‹ Epistulae now lost, to say nothing of important addresses

which he prepared for Nero, and the uncounted speeches
which he produced in his practice as an advocate. The
alleged correspondence between Seneca and St. Paul, as
well as several of the works which were credited to Seneca
in the Middle Ages, are now known to be spurious.²

¹ In theOearly printed editions of Seneca, there was for a long time a
failure to distinguish between the works of the Philosopher and those of
his father, Seneca Rhetor. Later, some critics undertook to distinguish
a third writer of the name, Seneca Tragicus; but it is now generally
assented that there was no such separate person⁴

²Attacks have been made also upon the authenticity of both tho
Consolatio ad Polybium and the Apocolocyntosis (or Ludus de Morte
Claudii) alternately, but though they are admittedly inconsistent with
each other, and both are in different ways inconsistent with a partial
aspect of Seneca’s character, the objections to the manuscript tradition
of Seneca's authorship are now generally discredited, and the internal
evidence of their style tends thoroughly to confirm it.
