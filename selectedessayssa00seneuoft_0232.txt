EPISTULA XVII

On the folly of postponing the pursuit of philosophy until one has
acquired riches. Poverty is often more convenient than wealth.

1. omnia ista: evidently explained by the following, moratur

. res familiaria— expedi aut incide: 110. untie the Gordian

knot or eut it. — Moratur, eto: cf. Luke xiv. 18, “And they all

with one consent began to make excuse,⁷’ e.q.s. — ut . . . possit:
so that Ι can retire from business.

2. eius . . . boni: 110. philosophy.—— summam . . . prosit:
220. the benefit of it in a general way,· contr. partes autem, ete. —
Ciceronis . . . verbo, opituletur: commonly included among the

fragments of Cicero's Hortensius: Fray. 98, ed. Mueller, Vol.
4 (3), p. 326. -— ad calculos: 110. caleulating whether you ean afford
it or not; cf. calculos ponere, Cone. ad Polyb. ix. 1.

3. quid si adpetenda est? sc. paupertas. In the dialogue de
Vita Beata, xxi. seq, Seneca discusses the question, evidently
pertinent to his own situation, quare opes contemnendas dicit et
habet? His answer is that riehes, though not essential, are evi-
dently a convenience. The philosopher may show more virtues
in proper conduct with wealth than without it.; non amat. divitias
scd mavult. He does not, like other men, feel the need of them
if they are gone. Cf. E ρ. 5, 6: 1711111111 animi est pati non posse
divitias. — Cum classicum, cte: when the sz'qnal sor battle sounds
(the poor man) knows that he is nat wanted. — cum ⁴' aqua' con-
clamata est: apparently instead of cryiug “fire!'’ they cried
water ! —— with which to put the fire out The poor man has merely
to walk out of the house, if it is hurning up; 110 has no property
to rescue. Cf. Dc Clem. Ι. xxv. 5.— non strepitat portus, ete:
i.c. he can go without making a great commotion.

4. cuius mores sanus dives imitatur: Seneca himself lived very
abstemiously. Cf. also Ep. 18, 5 seq.

5. nihil prius . . . parandum, etc.: zie. this should be the
first thing of all to see‘k, the knowledge of what should be sought.
— et parare (1.0. rationem parandi) disce: the more proper pre-
liminary. —- bene mori: suicide being the Stoic's justified resource.

6. ad hoc properantibus: bys those who arc aiminy at this. — quod
promittitur: as the reward of philosophy.
