182 NOTES, ΜΒ. 11, (JAP. lv-vi

1. ‘Sed quidam,⁷ etc.: an objection by a supposed disputant.
— obvios: men whom they meet. — in compendium: for profit. -—
occidendi causa: sor the mere salse os hillino. —saeviuntz inflict
torture. - Busiris: a lcgendary king of Egypt, who cruelly sacri-
ficed strangers to Jupiter and was himself slain by Hercules. —-
Procrustes: one of the mythical highwaymen of the Corinthian
isthmus, who violently fitted passing travellers to his iron bed,
and was himself despatched by Theseus.

2. non . . . laesa est: it (the emotion, standing for the person ’

who feels it) has not suffered injury. — extra finitionem nostram:
as given above, nihil aliud . . . poenis. —continebatz included
«nimy—possumus dicere, ete: Seneca by implication admits
that he is making a somewhat arbitrary distinction; cf. illos . . .
vocabo, below—varia . . . genera eius: ie. insaniae. In De
Iro, Ι. i. 2 Seneca speaks of anger as brevem insaniam. — nullum
certius: sc. yenus insaniae ; no lsz‘nd is more unmistokczble. —in

. . . pervenit: shows itself by.——lancinationesz savoya mutila-
tion (of its victims). The word is from the verb lancino, to teor
‘in piecesy to manyle.

3. causam . . . modum non: α reoson . . . but no moderatiori.
—Phaleris: a tyrant of Agrigentum, famous for his cruelty and
especially for the brazen bull 111 which he roasted men alive. He
was a familia-r example. —finiret conclude. — convenit: there is
harmonffl· i.e. there is no inconsistency between clemency and
strictness.

4. Et haec: this also, ie. as well as its opposite, cruelty. Seneca
naturally avoids mentioning that Nero’s Vellem nescirem litteras
(II. i. 2) was really an instance of pity, misericordia, rather than of

clemency. — Utraque, etc: ie. one of these is in the direction of
strictness, the other in that of elemeney; both of them we ought
to avoid. ——per speciem: cf. II. iii. 1, speciosum . . . nomen. —

leviore periculo, etc.: i.e. the latter error is less serious in its con-
sequemes, but it is equally far from what is ideally right.

V. The distinction of pity (misericordia) from clemency; popu-
lar misunderstanding of the Stoio attitude.

1. religio . . . colit, superstitio . . . violat: a hint, perhaps,
of the (lrift of Seneca’s lost work de Su perstitione (see Introd. p. xxi).
