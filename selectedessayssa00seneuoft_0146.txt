106 NOTES, CAP. 1-11

1. In the general destructibility of all created things, it is absurd
and impertinent to complain that what is fated for the whole
world is not averted from one’s own particular household.

1. The first sentence is incomplete. A beginning may easily
be supplied conjecturally; perhaps something like the following:
(Quereris siqna inania perenniora esse quam vitam nostram.- si
eorum sortem> nostrae compares, firma sunt, e.q.s. Evidently
there has been a comparison‚ perhaps by way of complaint from
Polybius, to something which does not perish so quickly as our
human lives, and which furnishes Seneca his natural antithesis.
The use of the second person, with an occasional supposed in-
terruption (occupatio) from the person addressed, is characteristic
of Seneca’s “ dialogue '’ form. ——redigasz the object is the word
to be supplied (e.g. siyna or eorum sortem, as above) for that
with which our transitory human lot is contrasted.—omnia:
object of destruentis and revocantis. — Septem illa miracula: the
familiar Seven Wonders of the World.—qua . . . mirabiliora:
object of exstruxit, the subject of which is annorum ambitio. At
the same time si qua is equivalent to quaecumque, whatever, and
with miracula, constitutes the subject of visentur. — solo aequata:
razed to the yround. — et (before desinit) : also.

2. Mundo . . . interitum: i.e. predict the final destruction oi
the world. This was a Stoic doctrine. — et . . . dissipabit et . . .
demerget: i.e. so they say ; note the shift in construction from
the oratio obliqua that would naturally come after minantur.
—confusionem veterem: primeval chaos. —eat . . . et: ie. let
some one, if he has the effrontery; cf. in English the colloquial
use of “ goes and does it,'' etc. —— Carthaginis . . . cinerem, stock
examples of particular disaster. — si quid: equivalent to quicquid,
whatever; cf. siqua, above. —hoc quod non habet, etc.: i.e. the
world, which has no place to which it can fall. —tantum . . .
nefas ausura: qoiny to commit such a dreadful deed as the destrue-
tion of the universe.

3. omnia: as before, object of revocantis, which agrees with
namma—ruinae: dative of separation depending upon sub-
trahat. —- ipsi mundo: depending upon imminenti.

4. quod gravissimum fecerat: the antecedent is id, understood,
object of secisse—crudelitatem . . . aequalitas: note the care-
fully balanced order of the words.
