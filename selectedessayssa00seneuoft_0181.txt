Messalina’s death in consequence of her outrageous misdeeds is
described in Tae. Ann. XI. 37-38. The freedman Narcissus
brought it about.—“Nescio,'' inquis: Suetonius (Claud. 39)
tells the absurd example 01 Claudius's absent-mindedness (oblivio
et inconsiderantia), when after having sanctioned Messalina’s
death 110 innoeently inquired why she didn’t come to dinner, cur
