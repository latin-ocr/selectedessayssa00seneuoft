APOCOLOCYNTOSIS , 139

—mea res agitur: I am personally interested in this affair.—
manus manum lavat: one hand washes the other. This same
proverb occurs in Petronius (45) and in varied forms in Greek.

X. 1. sententiae suae loco dicendae: i.e. when his turn came.
Some of Augustus’s early opinions upon Claudius are quoted by
Suetonius (Claud. 4); they are not fiattering. Cf. consol. ad Polyb.
xii. 5, illum qens sua caelo adserat. — pudor: it was a question of
family pride.

2. In hoc :sor this ? Then follows the familiar form of summary
of Augustus's achievements‚ from the Res Gestae Divi A uyusti. —
terra marique pacem: ef. De Clem. I. ix. 4.-—legibus urbem
fundavi: practically a quotation from Vcrg. Aen. VI. 810, where,
however, the statement, in the future, refers to Numa. —ut—:
aposiopesis—Messalae Corvini . . . sententiam: the words here
quoted seem to refer to an occasion in 25 Bc. when the distinguished
senator, M. Valerius Messala Corvinus, was appointed by Augustus
as the first prefect of the city, but soon resigned (Tac. A rm. VI. 11),
apparently in disgust at his new duties. A fragment from Sue-
tonius quotes him as intimating that the office was uneonstitutional.
It is a sardonie humor which puts a recollection that must have
been so unpleasant to Augustus into his own speech. —pudet1
se. me.

3. tam facile . . . quam: among other proverbs for things
easy to do, like our “as easy as falling off a log,” ef. Plaut. sslost.
559, Tam facile vinces quam pirum volpes comest,—“as easily

as a fox swallows a pear.'’ —Non vacat . . . intuenti: sc. mihi.
— domestica mala: ie. the people he has killed in my own family.
—illaz zze. publicas clades. — etiamsi soro‘r mea nescit, ego scio:

ἐ’γγιον γόνυ κνήμης; Ι know, even if my sister doesn't know (as
they say in Greek), my knee is nearer than my shin. The prov-
erb, which is Biicheler's correction here for an unintelligible string
of Greek letters in the Mss, appears several times in ancient Greek
proverbial collections. Cf. Plautus's tunica propior palliost
(Trinum. 1154), “my shirt is nearer than my eoat.'' The sense
of the quotation is plain, after Augustus’s reference to his domestica
mala: he eared most for the troubles that were nearest him. The
point of the statement, soror mea nescit, seems to depend upon
some fact unknown to us. Octavia had shown an almost per-
