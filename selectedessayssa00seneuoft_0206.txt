166 NOTES, LIB. Ι, CAP. XII—XIII

2. licet: concessive. -se togae reddiderit: retired to private
life. The dictatorship was a military office; hence the significance
of the return to civilian dress—septem milia: Seneca in De
Bencf. V. 16, 3, alludes to them as two legions. The number is
variously given by different authors. —ad aedem Bellonae: at
this temple, which stood just outside the city in the Campus Mar-
tius, the Senate received generals newly returned from war. Thc
seditiosi pauculi (note the diminutive) were being butehered
in the neighboring Villa Publica. ——Hoc agamus: let us attend
to our present* business.

3. Sed mox: sc. loquemur ; a promise not fulfilled in the extant
portion of the De Clementia. —utique, ete: 50. irascendum sit.-
and how (it is proper to bc anqry) if cili'zens have. yona ouer to the.
status of enemiess in De. Ira, I. xvi. 1, Seneca denies the propriety
of anger even in this case. — ex eodem corpore 2 ic. from the same
body politic. —uterque licet . . . valletur: althouyh oric uo less
than the other is defended by armed men.. — magna odia: the hatred
of his subjeets. —illas ipsas manus: ie. those of his guards.

4. Contrariis in contraria agitur: lie is driven in opposite direc-
tions by opposite motiucs. — exsecrabili versu: the words are from
Attius’s tragedy of Atreus (Frag. V. Attius, ll. 203—204, Ribbeck,
Traq. Rom. Fray.) and were a familiar quotation of the time, so
familiar as to be parodied (ef. Suet. Tib. 59). Seneca quotes them
again later (De Clem. II. ii. 2) and also in 1115 De Ira, I. xx. 4,
alluding to the fact that they were composed in Sulla's century. —
multos praecipites dedit: in particular allusion perhaps to Caligula,
who (Suet. Caliq. 30) was frequently aceustomed to repeat the
words—extrema admovens: se. timon· that suwests desperate
possibililieS. *iacentes excitat: rou-ses even the most passive.

5. feras . . . contineant: although a strzfny of scathers will
keep, etc. Seneca elsewhere (De Ira, Π. xi. 5) remarks that fieree
animals may be terrified by this device, and the observation was
familiar; ef. Verg. Geory. III. 372. — eques telis incessat: suppose
a horseman should attach, ete. Both contineant and incessat are
, “volitive'' subjunctives, one expressing etmeession, the other,
proviso—per ipsa: ic. the string of feathers.—proculcabunt
formidinem: they will trample doum (their own) sear. ——ultima
necessitas: ie. closporation.—Relinquat oportet . . . ostentet: sear
