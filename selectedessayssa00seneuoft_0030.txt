the part of Seneca's work which we now have, represent-
for us the attitude of reaction against literary changes
which were a natural symptom of changes fundamen-

It is not to be supposed that all the ancient criticisms
of Seneca were hostile. Quintilian himself, in another

place, uses the term copia to describe Seneca's (listinctive .

literary characteristic, and there were many highly com-

ancient opinion, however, is more worth quoting. It is
that of the half-mad emperor Caligula. Suetonius,² after
speaking of the vigor of Caligula’s own oratory, and es-
pecially his powers of denunciation, says he “so far de-
spised the milder and more elegant sort of composition
that he said that Seneca, who was then highly admired,
composed mere prize-declamations (commissiones), ‘sand
without lime ’ (et harenam esse sine calce).'' The remark
has often been misapplied. Caligula could not have
meant the philosophica] works of Seneca which we have
now, for they were written later; it must have referred
to his speeehes, and in view of its context it must mean
that Seneca, in the emperors judgment, lackcd strength
and force. But it is commonly taken to imply that
Seneca's work lacked cohesion‚ and to refer to the frag-

Few authors, indeed, furnish so large a proportion of
sententious observations that may be quoted apart from
their occasion, though many things in Seneca which seem
quite epigrammatic in form are, nevertheless, very depend-
