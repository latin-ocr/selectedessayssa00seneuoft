APOCOLOCYNTOSIS 143

6. Pedibus . . . itum est: the senatorial phrase for going over
to the side of a previous speaker, as in a “divis-ion? discessio,
instead of voting in individual speechcs. —nec mora: like the
inore common haud mora; sc. crat. —— Cyllenius: so called from
his birthplace on Mt. Cyllene, Mereury, the conductor of souls.
—colio obtorto: a familiar phrase; as we might say, “scizcd
him by the. c‹1›llar.’' &unde negant redire quemquam: from
Catullus, iii. 12. Cf. Hamlct (iii. 1):

“The undiscovorod country from whose bourn
No traveler returns.” ’

Vergil (Aen. VI. 128-129) is a little less positive. Sed revocare
yradum, . . . he says, Hic opus, hic labor cst. A caclo is, as a
gloss, bracketed. If, however, it is to be left in the text, Seneca
may have been joking at the rarity of any onc's returning from
heaven; on the opposite theory, eritics generally have prefixed
illuc to complete the verse from its source in Catullus.

XII. 1. per viam Sacram: naturally, the route α caclo ad
inferos led by way of earth; cf. xiii. 1. The. via Appia (ef. i. 2)
was a continuation of tho sanie street, which was distinctively the
street of processions—quid sibi velit . . . num . . . esset:
note the colloquial confusion of tenses, after the historical present.
——impensa cura: the elaborateness of Claudius’s funeral is at-
tested by Suetonius (Ncro, 9) and Tacitus (A'nn. XII. 69).—
deum efferri: that (ι. qod was being] carried out to burial. — omnis
generis aenatorum: players upon every kind os bross ‘instrument-s,-

there was a “innon'’ of these musicians ‘at Rome, the colleyium Δ

aeneatorum (or aenatorum).

2. Agatho: apparently one of the causzssdzsscfss· otherwise unknown.
— causidici plorabant: Claudius had been excessively patient
with them (Suet. Claud. 15'); but his especial title to their regard
was his partial abrogation of the Lem Ginaia, under which the
acceptance of sees by them had been illegal. — sed: the adversa-
tive is to the pauci; they made up in sincerity what they lacked
in numbers—Iurisconsulti: Icqal advisers (distinguished from
advocati as definitely as attorneys from barristers), who had been
of small account under the eaprices of Claudius's adininistration.
—capita conferentes: yettinq their heads toyether. —non semper
