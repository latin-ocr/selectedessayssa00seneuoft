MACMILLAN'S

LATIN CLASSICS

PREPARED UNDER THE DIRECTION oF
JAMES C. EGBERT

PROFESSOR OF LATIN 1N COLUMBIA UNIVERsrrY

FOR THE YOUNGER STUDENTS IN COLLEGE CLASSES

Although great progress has been made during recent years in the
scholarly editing of Latin texts, the result has been books too cumbersome
and expensive for the younger students. Not finding helpful information
in the elaborate introduction with its extensive (lata as to usages, quota-
tions, and references, the student naturally turns to translations for aid.
The volumes in this new series will endeavor to combat this tendency by
presenting notes which, while scholarly, shall be brief and concise. Each
book will have a short introduction and standard text and a commentary
sor the interpretation of the text. The series will contain the most useful
works available for class use and will be issued at prices sufficiently reason-
able to make the adoption of the volumes possible in large general classes.
Arrangements for editing the various texts have been made as follows:
