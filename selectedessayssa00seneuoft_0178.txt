138 NOTES, CAP. IX-X

potiundi, Cic. de Ley. II. 11, 28). It has been suggested that she
was Fortuna (the mother of Plutus, according to Phaedrus IV. 12, 5) ;
and also, by a quite different explanation, she has been identified
with Cybele, the “Great Mother'’ (vid. Hoeing in Am. Jour.
Philol. xxiv. pp. 323—326). Old—fashioned gods like Diespiter
doubtless seemed quaint enough to Romans of Seneea's time
to suggest themselves for caricature. And in the practices as-
cribed to Diespiter it is probable that some freedman of Claudius
is satirized.—nummulariolusz a eomie diminutive from num-
mularz‘us, a word of a common plebeian type. —hoc quaestu:
i.e. ammonitioni—vendere civitatulas: another diminutive for
eomic effect. The gibe is plainly at the venality of public prefer-
ments in Claudius’s day; recall also (iii. 3) dum . . . civitate
donaret. —auriculam illi tetigit: as wc should say, “gave him
the wink.'’ But touching the car was a regular sign of summons
as a witness; ef. Hor. Sat. I. 9, 77. Diespiter is thus admonished
to stand by his fellow—trader in citizenships. The diminutive
auricula is quite elassical, but the effect of three such forms in
quiek suceession is notieeable.

5. Divus Claudius: the Roman senate had already decreed the
title. —Augustum . . . nec minus Divam Augustam: the latter
even more, in faet; Claudius's father, Nero Claudius Drusus,
was the son of Diva Augusta (Livia) by her first marriage ; Clau-
dius's mother, Antonia Minor, was a daughter of Octavia, Augus-
tus'ssister.—quam ipse . . . iussit: as stated in Suet. Claud. 11
and Dio, LX. 5. — e re publiea: to the public interest, in regular
senatorial phraseology. — ferventia rapa vorare: devour boilinq-hot
turnips (instead of ambrosia), a hint at Claudius’s voracity; the
words form the end of a hexameter verse, the source of which is
unknown. But an epigram of Martial (XIII. 16) alludes to the
fact that Romulus in heaven eats turnips, the rustic fare of his
time on earth. —censeo uti, ete: note the change of structure
from uti . . . sit to rem . . . adiciendam (csse).—ad Meta-
morphosis Ovidi, where Romulus’s and Julius Cacsar's apotheoses
were already included, Met. XIV. 815; XV. 745.

6. sententiam vincere: on the analogy of causam vincere.—
ferrum suum in igne esse: zze. he was striking while the iron was
hot. —- modo . . . illuc: tle. to different nicinbors of the asseinbly.
