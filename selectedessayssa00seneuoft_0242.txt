2. moralem philosophiam: this, to which Seneca alludes also
in Ep. 109, 17, is evidently one of his lost works.—ius . . .
dicerem: as of a judge announcing a judicia] decision. — tam longe
venientem: since you come from¹ sofar, zze. from Sicily.

3. si qua: sc. alia, later.— magis iuvat quam prodest: it is
more interesting] than usesul. — bonum an corpus sit: whether “the
900d” (zle. goodness) is a corporea] cntity. The question of course
belongs to that department of Stoic teaching which was called
“physics,'’ zze. in modern terminology‚ metaphysics. Seneca's
answer is the orthodox one of the Stoics, who were as far as pos-
sible in this respect from Platonic idealism. Similar inquiries
were familiar. Cf. ey. in Aulus Gellius, V. 15, a discussion of
the question corpusne sit vox cm incorporeum. Vid. Zeller (The
Stoics, Epicuream, and Sceptics), chapter vi„ in connection with
this epistle.

4. Bonum facit: i.e. the good is operative, has an effect upon
things. The philosophical problem of how mind can act upon
matter, the Stoics solved by denying the essential dualism of the
two. — quae animi sunt: sc. bona, corpora sunt.

5. an adfectus corpora sint: in another Epistle (113), however,
Seneca discusses the further question, αη . . . virtutes animalia
sunt, and disposes of it by a ,reductio ad absurdum. Cf. note to
rotundus, Apoc. viii. 1.— tamquam: sor exampla— nisi dubitas
the reality of their physical effects‚ which are enumerated in the
following clauses. -— frontem adstringant, in a scowl of anger.—
faciem diffundant: rclaae the cozmtenance in a pleasant smile.

7. eadem . . . indicia: ic. they have physical consequences.
—ex illis est: results from them.

8. Tangere, etc: De Rerum Natura, I. 304. Here again
Seneca is borrowing from an Epicurean.

9. Etiam nunc: by way of introducing another argument.—
cui: the subject is the antecedent of corpus est.

11. morem gessi: I have complied with your request in stating
for you our doctrine. —— latrunculis: with pafwns, as in the game
of chess (or with checkers), ic. we are engaged in a mere game
with trifles. — in . . . teritur: our acumen is spent on useless ques·
tion-s. — ista: supervacua.

12. ad mentem bonam uti litteris: ie to pursue literary studies
