THE LIFE OF SENECA xiii

which is not without importance in the history of political
ideas. When a palace revolution had removed Claudius
by means of the historic poisoned mushrooms and had
placed Nero on the throne, Seneca, in cooperation with
Burrus, the elderly commander of the Pretorian guard,
was practically the ruler of the empire during the first
five years of Nero's principate, the Quz'nquennz'um Neronis
which Trajan praised so highly, while the bad qualities
of the would-be artist-emperor were kept under cover by
the amiability of his own ingenuous youth and the con-
trolling presence of his teacher. Seneca undertook to
teach the lesson of imperial clemency‚ which he already
saw was peculiarly needed.

But Agrippina's jealous ambition presently made her
intolerable to the son whom she had placed on the throne.
When Nero had finally secured his mother⁷s assassina-
tion (59 A.D.) Seneca, while he is not known to have
participated in the criminal design in advance, so far lent
himself to it afterward, it was believed, as to write Nero’s
apology for it to the Senate, justifying it on the ground
of state necessity. The extent of Seneca’s culpability for
this is something that we cannot judge. The situation
was complex; even the statement that Seneca wrote
Nero’s defence has been denied; more probably, however, ’
it seemed to him that there was no alternative if he was
to keep any influence over his increasingly difficult pupil.
The well-known fresco ¹ from Herculaneum, representing
a butterfly in a chariot driving a griffon, is commonly sup-
posed to have been intended to suggest the relation of
Seneca to Nero, the butterfly as the symbol of the soul
standing for such control as could be exercised through
