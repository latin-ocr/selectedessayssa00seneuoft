contrast between the references to Claudius in it and in the
A pocolocyntosis. The lapse of consistency is of course obvious;
the attitude of the Consolatio appears to be an unhappy example
of the policy which Seneca justifies in his De Constantia Sapientis,¹
the offer of a sop to the watch-dog, the toll paid at the gate in
order that one may be allowed to pass; on the other hand, it has
been suggested that its flatteries of Claudius are only ironical,
and some such thought can hardly have been wholly absent from
Seneca's mind.

Dio, however, says ² that Seneca, sick of his exile, sent to Rome
from the island a petition (βιβλίον) in which he flattered Messa-
lina and the freedmen of Claudius, but which afterward, when he
had risen to the highest distinction, he was ashamed of and tried

of Messalina and speaks of only one freedman. Possibly the

Umbrarum nullo ver est laetabile foetu,
Nullaque in infausto nascitur herba solo.

Non panis, non haustus aquae, non ultimus ignis:
Hic sola haec (luo sunt, exsul et exsilium.

Another of the epigrams, entitled Querela, contains the suggestive
outburst, dolor omnia coyit, which is by no means Seneca’s only con-
fession that “ the flesh is weak.’' All of the epigrams arc sufficiently
in contrast with Seneca’s courageous independencc in the Consolatio ad
