xii INTRODUCTION

When Seneca was about forty-five years old, this career
received a serious check in a peremptory banishment to
the dreary island of Corsica. The cause is not ¹exactly
known. It was charged that he was implicated in an
intrigue with the notorious younger Julia, but the charge
came from the Empress Messalina, herself no less notorious.
Whether Seneca was in any way guilty, or whether he had
been merely indiscreet and his penalty was the result of
one of Claudius’s ill—directed efforts at old-fashioned
Roman severity, we cannot say. Tacitus alludes to
Seneca's memory of his exile as an iniuria. At any rate,
though at first he faced it courageously (as we infer from
his essay ad Helviam matrem cle Consolatione), it caused
him a distress which in the Consolatio ad Polybium and
the Epiyrams he made very evident. It lasted for about
eight years, until by the influence of the new-made em-
press, Agrippina, he was recalled to be the tutor of her
son, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, whom we know as the
Emperor Nero. Seneca was thus reinstated in the
highest social life of Rome, to his own great satisfaction
and that of the people, with whom he was a favorite, and
partly for the sake of whose good opinion Agrippina is
said to have interfered in Seneca’s favor.¹

To Seneca's relation with his imperial pupil we owe an
amplified perception of the imperial power and function

¹ Tacitus (Annales, XII. 8) says: But Agrippina . . . obtainedapardon
from exile for Annaeus Seneca, and at· the same time obtained the prae-
torship for him, having in view both his popularity with the. public on
account of his scholarly distinction and also the advantage of such a
teacher for the youth of Domitius, and of their having his advice in their
effort to secure the throne, since it was believed that Seneca would be
faithful to Agrippina in gratitude for her kindness, and an enemy to
Claudius in resentment for the injury that had been done him.
