136 Nomas, CAP. vin-lx

this would refleet upon her as well, Seneca ean hardly have in-
tended it in that way. — caeli, ete.: from a familiarly quoted line
of Ennius's lost tragedy of Iphiycnia, Quod est ante pedes nemo
spectat, caeli scrutantur playa& Vahlen ed. Εηη. Poes. Reliq, p.
160. —- templum in Britannia: one at Camultmlmmm is mentioned
by Tacitus (Αηη. XIV. 31). — μωροῦ εὺιλάτου τυχεῖνῑ to fimi Irim
a placable crazy man, a parody on wishes that a god might be
propitious; cf. μωροῦ πληγήν vii. 3.

IX. 1. privatis . . . morantibuS, ete: apparently an allusion
to a rule of the Roman senate; licere is the subject of ¹venit. —- Ego
contrasted with vobis and vos, — P. C.: in jocose comparison to
the patres conscripti of Rome. ——mera mapalia: simply γιώὸίεή,
stuff and nonsense. mapalia, according to Festus, originally
designated a kind of African (Punic) huts, but it had become
proverbial in the derived sense. —Hic: Claudius.

2. 1110 dimisso: apparently Claudius was sent out in conform-
ance with the rule. But at the end of the next chapter Augustus
addresses him direetly as if he were still present. —interrogatur
sententiam: the retained object is particularly common in this
expression. —Ianus pater: partly perhaps in view of his ehar-
acter as god of openings, but conventionally because the consul
desiyfnatns was regularly thus called upon first; ef. ay. Sall. Cat. 50.
—postmeridianus consul: perhaps a mere joke upon file ludi-
crously short honorary consulships that were becoming common.
But July 1 was a usual date for the entering of consules suffecti
upon their office, and postmeridianus may indicate the second half—
year, as we say “the afternoon of life ''; Seneca alluded to his own
old age as postmeridianas horas, Nat. Quaest. ΙΙΙ. praef. 3. —
ἅμα, πρόσσω καὶ ὂπίσσ-ωῑ at once both before and behind, referring
to the two-faced Janus; quoted, however, from the. Iliad, III. 109,
where the aged Priam is described as looking both to the past and
the future. -- diserte quod in Foro vivebat: the Arcus Ianus was
on the north side of the Forum, a good place for acquiring fluency.
—notarius: the stenographer. Shorthand writing (Notae Tiro-
m'anac) was common enough so that the business of the notarius
was a well—defined one, and the term occurs in sepulchral in-
scriptions as wcll as in literature.

3. hunc . . . honorem: ilc. deification. *iam famam mimum
