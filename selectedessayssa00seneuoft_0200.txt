note the non-Ciceronian transitive use of eyressus. The allusion
helps to fix the date of the De Clementia as not long aster Decem-
ber, 55 A.D. Augustus, however, born in September, 63 B.c., was
over twenty at the time of the proscriptions of 43. — pugiones in

2. cum annum quadragensimum transisset: this is the Ms.
reading. Another version of the story, given by Dio Cassius
(LV. 14—22)‚ dates it 4 A.D., when Augustus had passed (several
years) beyond sixty. It has been suggested by lVesscling that
Seneca's text should read sexayesimum (supposing the present
reading to be due to an easy corruption from LX to XL) in view
of Dio’s statement and of Seneca's epithet, senex, applied to
Augustus in xi. 1. Cinna, inoreover‚ according to the Fasti,
was consul ΛΦ. 5. (Cf. the end of this chapter ix.) But if
Seneca had thought of Augustus as sixty-six years old, he would
hardly have qualified his opithot by the following words, aut iam
’ἱη senectutem annis rcryentibus; and we have no other evidence
that Augustus was in Gaul so late in life. It seems probable
11131 1116 apparent error is Seneca's rather than a copyist's. This
may be one of the matters in which, according to Quintilian’s
criticism, Seneca was inisled by secretaries to whom he intrusted
the investigation of particular points—in Gallia moraretur:
Augustus was in Gaul when he was about* forty-seven years
old. Dio, however, puts the. incident in Rome. —L. Cinnam:
Cn. Cornelius Cinna Magna& according to Dio, Γναῖος Κορνήλιος
θυγατριδοῦς τοῦ μεγάλου Πομπηίου ὥν (Gnaeus Cornelius, son os
the dausyhtcr of Pompey the Grcat), which agrees with the
inscriptions showing his name. Apparently the praenomen Lucius
is here an error of Seneca's. This Cinna's father was the L.
