AD LUCILIUM ErisTULA Vn 187

their effect upon Nero, and that the other books appeared not
long after their author's death.

Manuscripts of the Epistulae Morales are more numerous than
those of any of Seneca's other works. At some time in the medi-
acval period (probably in the ninth century) the existing collection
of letters was divided into two parts. The best authority for the
text of the first part, consisting of the first thirteen books (Ep. 1—
88),ss a Paris manuscript of the tenth century, Number 8540 in
the Bibliotlz‘eque Nationale. The text of the second part, Books
xlv-XX„ is based chiefly upon a manuscript at Bamberg (codor
Bamberqcnsi's V. 14) of about the end of the ninth century, and
a manuscript of the ninth or tenth century (Aryentoratensz's C VI.
5) which was destroyed by fire at Strasburg in 1870 during the
German siege. Fortunately it had been collated by Biicheler before
that time.

EPISTULA VII

On the need of avoiding the corrupting influences of the crowd„
especially of the brutal public shows. Evil example does great
injury. A few friends should be sought, with whom we can be
mutually helpful ; more are not necessary even as an audience for
our literary work.

1. Seneca . . . salutem: sc. dicim the ordinary form in be-
ginning a letter and often even more abbreviated—quaeris:
questions from Lucilius furnish the text for many of Seneca’s
letters—Turbam: in the preface to Book IV. of the Naturales
Quaestiones Seneca commends Lucilius for‘his natural inclina-
tion to avoid the crowd, and gives him the same advice. Else-
where in a slightly different sense he says (De I'z't. Beat. ii.)‚ ar-
yumentum pessimi turba est, on the vulgarity of arguing from the
opinion of the majority. — committeris: with reflexive sense
(middle voice). —numquam mores quos extuli refero: a frank
confession of Seneca’s old age which is to be remembered in view
of the inconsistencies charged against him by others; cf. Ep. 8. 3.
—quod composui: the part os my character which I have put in
order. —sine offensa proferantur: are taken out os doors without
prejudice to their health. — ex longo morbo: i.e. moral weakness.
