AD NERONEM CAESAREM DE CLEMENTIA LIBRI II

THE De Clementia was written for Nero after he had been in
power 3 little more than a year. Its date is approximately de-
termincd by the allusion to his age, 111 I. ix. 1, indieating that he
had just finished 1115 eighteenth year; Nero’s eighteenth birthday
was December 15, 55 Α. D. The dedication of the essay seems really

De Clementia appeared. And in the essay Seneca seeks by every

good, others much less noble. The clement of flattery 15 of course
inevitable, but it is ingenious and grave and moderate. Bearing
in mind the necessities of the case, one finds little that can be said
seriously to belie Seneca's final reflection upon 1115 relations with
the Emperor, “ that his own character was not inclined to adulation
