AD POLYBIUM DE CONSOLATIONE 115

qua (sc. die) illum gens sua caelo adserat: late . . . be the day,
on which his kindred (Divus Iulius and Divus Augustus) claim
him sor heaven. The assonance of sera and adserat at thc be-
ginning and end is perhaps intentional, and with nepotibus nostris
balanced against qens sua makes a whimsieal sort of chiasmus.

redeas,· cf. also me . . . adsere caelo, Ov. Met. I. 761. As to
