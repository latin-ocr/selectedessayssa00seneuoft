122 NOTES, CAP. va

of things great and small. —alio: adverb. — servet: sc. eloquentia
tua. — hoc . . . ipsum: ie. the business of consolation. — aliquid:
i.e. a certain amount of grief. — vanitate: sentimentalism. In

Ep. 63, Seneca begins thus a consolation to Lucilius upon the
death of a friend: Moleste sero discessisse Flaccum amicum tuum,

plus tamen aequo dolere te nolo.

5. ex toto: at all. —quosdam . . . viros: evidently “Hard—
shell'' or “Middle-of-the—road'' Stoics.—sapientem: the Stoic
ideal.

6. Satis praestiterit ratio, ete: reason will have done enouqh is
only she removes from yricf that which, etc. —ut . . . patiatur:
that it (reason) should not permit any (grief) to exist at all,· a sub-
ject clause—servet: the subject is still ratio—piae mentis

. . nec motae: os a mind that is affectionate without being] un-
balanced.

7. ut frequenter . . . velis, etc.: with this has been compared
the strikingly similar sentiment in the last chapter of Tacitus’s
Aqricola: I d filiae quoque uxorique praeceperim, sic patris, sic mariti
memoriam venerari, ut omniasacta dictaque eius secum revolvant, etc.
— quod . . . poteris: relative, referring to the preceding clauses,
which are the objects of effice.

8. modestiam eius: i.e. fratris tui—tuto: with possibly a
shade of irony in the adverb ; flattering prophecies could at least
now never be discredited.

9. longo iam situ . . . animo: with a mind exhausted and dulled
by long] rustiny (in exile); a parting appeal from the pathos of
Seneca's own situation—parum respondere ingenio, cte: as
Seneca said earlier (iii. 3), nihil est difficilius quam mayno dolori
paria verba reperire. —quam non possit is . . . tenent: how he
who is kept full os his own troubles cannot be free for the consolation
of another. —Latina . . . verba succurrant: Latin words . .
suyyest themselves. Ovid under similar conditions complains that
he has forgotten the Latin tongue in learning that of the bar-
barians among whom he lived (Tristia, V. El. xii. 57). — barbaris
. . . . gravis: distressing] even to barbariam, os a less uncouth sort.
