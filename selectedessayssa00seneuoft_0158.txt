of the kind is recorded of Sextus’s sister. His daughter was en—
gaged in marriage to Octavius's nephew, Marcellus, while Sextus
was negotiating with the members of the second Triu1nvirate;
but the breaking off of the negotiations could scarcely have been
caused by her death, for she is said later to have been married to
another man, Scribonius Libo. —superstes optimo fratri: Sex-
tus’s brother Gnaeus was killed at Munda, while they were pro-
longing the resistance to Julius Caesar after their father's death. —-
in hoc: explained by the following clause. — ne minus alte, etc.:
another evident reflection of the doctrine of the envy of Fortune;
cf. ii. 7. — sed etiam bello suffecit: Sextus Pompey was defeated
in a naval battle by Agrippa (36 Rc.) and was killed by some of
Antony’s lieutenants within the next year.

domus exemplis: with instances from my own family history.—
Fortunam . . . quam sciet . . . concupisse: the For-tune which
he knows (fut.) to have desired the tears os the Caesars, again in allu-
sion to the divine envy.

3. Octaviam sororem: Augustus lost his sister 11 B.c. and
delivered a funeral oration in her honor. Her own obstinate
refusal to be comforted after the death of her son Marcellus,

Seneca records in the Consol. ad Marciam, ii.—ei: dative of

Marcellus; cf. Verg. Aen. VI. 860 seq. — generos: Marcellus and

erat: tle. before his deification.

4. Gaius Caesar: not the Emperor Caligula, but the son of
M. Agrippa and Augustus's daughter Julia. Both he and his
brother Lucius were adopted by their grandfather Augustus; and
among their early honors the title of Princeps Iuventutis was
conferred upon them by the knights. Lucius died A. D. 2; Gaius
about a year and a half later. — volnere . . . corporis: the wound
was given by treachery in Armenia, and Gaius died soon after.—
