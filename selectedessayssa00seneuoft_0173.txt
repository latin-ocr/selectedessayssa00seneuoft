on which Lugudunum was situatcd at the junction of the Rhone
and the Saoiie. —— Phoebus ortu: the sun at his rising opposite. —
Ararque dubitans: recall Caesar, BG. Ι. 12, 011 the sluggishness of
the Saone. — spiritus tui: of your lzfe.

mind.—p.oeposs πληγήν; stroke of the σταῖς] mon, a parody on
1110 proverbial θεοῦ πληγή of Greek tmgedy, denoting a sudden
