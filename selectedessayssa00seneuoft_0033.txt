THE STYLE OF SENECA’S WRITINGS XXiX

of style, some of them the very ones with which Seneca
himself is commonly charged.

Seneca’s inconsistencies, however, are rarely of 1110 kind
which cannot be resolved; and we can perhaps fairly
summarize his preferences in a way not essentially out 01
harmony with his practice in his own prose. He wanted
the style to be natural ² and appropriate, as an artistic
Stoic should. He disliked what he thought grandiose
and pretentious. Bombastic affectation he expressly
ridicules in the Apocolocyntosis.2 He records his dislike
for long periodic sentences; ³ this obviously squares
with his practice. Of his epistolary style, which was
practically that of all his philosophic works‚ he says that
he wished it to be simple and unaffected like his conversa-
tion, which was inlaboratus et sacilis; tales esse epistulas
meas volo, quae nihil habent accersitum (ie. far—fetched,
recherche) nec fictum.4

But in commending the epistolary style 01 Lucilius
he says, habes verba in potestate? and when in another place
he observes that it is disgraceful to say one thing and
mean another, —turpe est aliud loqui aliud sentire: quanto

turpius aliud scribere, aliud sentire ‘⁵ — he is clearly think-
* ing not so much of the question 01 sincerity as 01 3 suffi—
cient command 01 one⁷s diction to be able to say effectively
just what one means. While Seneca disapproved of the
appearance 01 elaboration, he did like a neatness and pre-
cision which accentuated his points, put the effective
word in the right place, and in general made the expres-
sion fit the thought. He spoke often contemptuously of

utar interdum temerarie verbis et proprietatis modum excedam.
