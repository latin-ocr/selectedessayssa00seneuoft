AD LUCILIUM EPISTULAE MORALES

Seneea’s friend Lucilius, to whom he addressed not only the
Letters but also the De Providentia and the Naturales szestiones,
was a procurator 01 Sicily, unknown to us except through Seneea's
writings. Though he was 01 comparatively humble origin, his
proficieney in legal ,and literary studies raised him to equestrian
rank, and he was the author of a poem on Aetna, perhaps the one
which has been partially preserved to us along with the poems 01
Vergil. He was a younger man than Seneca, as we learn from
Epistle 26, 7; and in the prefaee to Book IV. 01 the Naturales
Quaestione-5 Seneca eompliments him upon his freedom from am-
bition and his fondness 101 quiet and literary pursuits.

Seneca's Letters are short ethical treatises, ostensibly written
for Lucilius's philosophie guidanee, but evidently intended for
publicatiom their epistolary form is suited to their discursive-
ness and the variety 01 their subjects, which are taken from the
interests 01 Seneea's daily life and topics suggested by Lucilius’s
correspondenee. In literary style they are among the most fin-
ished 01 Sencea’s works. They were written during the last years
01 1115 life, many of them probably while he was living in partial
retirement, after having lost 1115 influenee at the imperial court, and
was seeking his satisfactions in philosophie observation and in
the final preparation 01 1115 50111. There are frequent allusions
in them to his own old age. As to their date we cannot be entirely
precise, but they probably range from about 58 or 59 to 64 A.D.‚
or the end 01 Seneea's life, ΑΛ). 65.

The one hundred and twenty-four existing epistles were grouped
in twenty books. We know that the division into books was
ancient, and also that some of them are now lost, from the fact
that Aulus Gellius, writing in the second century, makes a quota-
11011 110111 1110 twenty-second book which does not occur in the
letters we have. It is believed that 1110 first three books (Ep-
1—29) were publishcd by Seneca himself, perhaps with a view to
