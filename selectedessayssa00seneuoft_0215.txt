AD NERONEM DE CLEMENTIA 175

N

XXI. Of personal vengeance the prince should consider him-
self, as he is, above the need; and generosity to a fallen enemy
enhances his reputation.

1. in reliquum: sor the future.— alieno malo: i.e. by showing
that he can do an injury. ——- opinionem: reputation. — quos pares
aliquando habuit: tle. fallen foes.—Regem . . . servabat, as
Seneca has already practically said, in v. 4 and 6.

2. Uti animose: to use in a noble spirit. — dandi auferendique:
dependent upon potens. —— quos . . . par fastigium obtinuisse: cf.
quos pares habuit, above. The case of Britannicus occurs to us
in illustration, but> Nero had spoiled that for contemporary use;
conquered kings are meant. — hoc arbitrium: tle. dandi auferendi-
que vitam potentiam.— perdidit . . . qui debet: i.e. he no longer
feels that it belongs to him; note the change of subject from

3. regnum . . . suum . . . relinqui apud eum: his (the de-

the exclamation attributed to Caractacus, the conque-red British
chief, when he first saw the palaces of Rome: “What did you
want of our hovels?'’

4. minoris: genitive of value, predicate of adflixisse eos.—
animalibus . . . obterentem inquinantibus: creatures that defile the
one who crushes them.— in ore civitatis: talked about.— servati
punitique: whether they are &pared or punished.

XXII. In the case of other rnen’s injuries there are three pos-
sible motives for inflicting punishment; the reformation of the
