AD POLYBIUM DE CONSOLATIONE 107

11. Grief is of no practical use; yet so far as my own personal
unhappiness allows Ι will join you in a complaint to Fortune, who
has attacked you in your only vulnerable point.

1. Illud: i.e. si cogitaveris. — nihil profuturum: a reflection of
the Stoic teaching that impulse should be controlled by reason. —-
quicquid . . . superfuit, etc.: note the gentle hint of Seneca's
own situation. ——tuae: sc. fortunae.—fletibus domesticis: with
tears sor myself. Yet Seneca had told his mother (Consol. ad
Helv. xx.) to think of him in exile as laetum et alacrem velut
optimis rebus.

2. Quid cessas? Why do you hesitate? The word cesso was
particularly used of letting a case go by default in court. — om-
nium iudicio: in the opinion of every one. ——- Fortuna: vocative-—
eum hominem continuisse: to have preserved this mam· i.e. Polybius.
—— effugeret invidiam: ie. the jealousy of men ; but Fortune at least
was envious ; cf. ξ 7.—salvo Caesare: abl. abs.; by a conventional
politeness which assumed that the death of Caesar would have been
an even greater sorrow. —bene . . . circuisses: had thorouyhly
reconnoitred his character.-—hac parte: i.e. on the side of his
fraternal affection. —paterez sc. illum.

3. faceres: deliberative subjunctive ; the tense shows that the
question was past and no longer offered a possibility. —illi ob-
noxius: dependent upon it.

4. expediat: impersonal. The friendship of the powerful freed-
men in Caesar’s household was naturally much sought after.

5. ipsa: with te, zle. Fortuna—liberalibus disciplinis: note
the Stoic significance given to this expression, —training which
frees a man from bodily limitations.

6. spiritum: lise. -— meliore sui parte: ie. in his immortal
thoughts. Cf. Martial, X. ii. 8: Et meliore tui parte superstes eris.

—— eloquentiae . . . operibus: cf. chapters viii. and xi. -— quorum
se ingeniis vel contulit vel . . . adplicuit: to whose qenins he has
made himself a rival or . . . has devoted himself; a reference to

his translations of Homer and Vergil. Cf. viii. 2 and xi. 5.

7. excogitasti, still addressing Fortune. The idea of the “ envy
of the gods” (ὁ φθόνος τῶν θεῶν) is further developed in the
following, quo melior . . . hoc saepius—ferre te . . . sine ullo
dilectu furentem: ie. showing your cruelty without any discrimi-
