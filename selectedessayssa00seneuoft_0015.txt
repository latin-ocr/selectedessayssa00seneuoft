Tim LirE or sENECA xi

derstood as a superstitious observance of some half dis-
reputable cult. Seneca became an authority upon super-
stitions —at least to the extent of writing a book about
them —and he had no disposition to be thought a prey
to one. The act was characteristic in its reconciliation of
a philosophie breadth of mind with the regard for appear-
ances and other practical considerations that are essential
to getting on in the world. In another letter ¹ he remarks,
apropos of his own manner of life, tamquam in conspectu
vivamus, —let us live without any necessity for conceal—
ment, —which is an honorable sentiment, but not based
upon a perfectly ideal independence of the opinions of
surrounding humanity, to which indeed even more con-
sistent Stoics than Seneca rarely attained. Later in this
same letter he describes among his frugal habits his simple
luncheon, consisting of such kinds of food, as he oddly
relates, that he does not have to wash his hands after it;
he takes but little exercise, he says, for after a slight exer-
tion he finds himself tired; he sleeps very little, as little
as possible, in fact; and presently he goes on to say,
fremitum patientissime fero. He seems to have con-
scientiously cultivated the practice of mental concentra-
tion, so that he could apply his mind to his work, as he
tells Lucilius, undisturbed by distracting sounds around
him. In Epistle 56 we find him explaining how he
managed to study composedly while staying in very
noisy lodgings over a public bath at a watering place.
These are the remarks of Seneca's old age, but they un-
doubtedly indicate an interest in mental and moral ex-
periment that went with him through life, along with the
external incidents and allurements of an active career.
