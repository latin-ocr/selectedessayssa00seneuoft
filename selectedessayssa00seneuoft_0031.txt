THE STYLE OF SENECA’s WRITINGs XXVli

ent upon their connection 101 111011 sense. Preoccupied as
Seneca was with ethic-al interests, he perpetually rounded
his thought up into quotable generalizations.¹ And the
talent 101· generalization carried Seneca far in the manner
01 it. He undoubtedly cared very much to be effective,
and we often feel in his writings the air 01 011011 which is
almost inseparable from an epigrammatic style.

It is this, perhaps quite as much as the striking differ-
ence between the austerity 01 1113 philosophy and the opu-
lence of his 1110, which has produced the impression 01 cant
and insincerity upon the minds of some 01 1113 readers.
Seneca had a taste for preaching‚ and 101 preaching artis-

supervacuis subtilitas teritur, nec faciunt bonos ista, sed
doctos,·3 and in countless other places the burden 01 1113
speech is as 110 once sums it up: doce quod necesse est!
Even 11 there is some cant in Seneca, it does not prove his
general insincerity‚ but simply that he was sometimes
carried away by his manner of thinking. It is a fault,
but not 10 be dismissed with condemnation unqualified.⁵

passages in 1110 Christian Scriptures.
