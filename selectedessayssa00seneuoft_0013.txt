1. THE LIFE OF SENECA

AMONG the Spanish writersl who produced so much
of the Roman literature of the first century, Lucius
Annaeus Seneca, the philosopher, especially if we con-

is easily the foremost. Taken by itself‚ the body of his
writings is the most important of its kind in Latin liter-
ature, but it gains a peculiar interest when considered as
the literary expression of a character and a career so
paradoxical, in many aspects, as his. Only once, per-
haps, — a century later when Marcus Aurelius was on the
throne, ——has a professed philosopher ever been nearer
to ruling the world. From every point of view Seneca’s
life is noteworthy.

He was born at Corduba about 4 B.C. and was brought
to Rome in the latter part of the principate of Augustus.
His father, M. (or L.) Annaeus Seneca, known as Seneca
Rhetor because of his works on the rhetorical exercises
called Suasoriae and controversiae, was a knight and a
man of substance and culture. His mother, Helvia, was
a lady of Corduba, of whose character Seneca has given
us a noble estimate. His elder and younger brothers
were M. Annaeus Novatus, better known as that Gallio
