196 NOTES

3. cui mens . . . constat: whose mind is not driven di-stracted.
— adsidua salutatio: a much niilder affiiction than the.miscel-
laneous noisc Seneca has described. We have no knowledge that
Chrysippus the philosopher perished in this way; apparently the
present individual is a contemporary of Seneca and Lucilius— ’
cuidam genti, etc.: Seneca tells the. same. thing in his discussion
of the Nile in the Naturales szestfzfones, IV. ii. 5.

4. fabrum: α earpenter.— serrarrium: a sawyer.— Meta Su-
dans: a fountain in Rome, so called probably because in shape it
resembled a meta (goal). The core of brick work which remains
of it near the Colosseuni is apparently of the Flavian period, and
its construction is generally credited to Domitiam but since the
name occurs here in Seneca, Domitian‘s work must have been a
reconstruction of something of an earlier date. — tubulas . . . et
tibias: little trumpets and fimo-3, apparently in some sort of beg-
ging device common in the vicinity of the Meta Sudans.

5. audire . . . possim: ile. without being disturbed.— si adfec-
tus fremunt: if the passions raqc.

6. Omnia noctis erant, cte: a verse from P. Terentius Varro
Atacinus's poem called Arqonautae (adapted from the Aryo-
‘nautica of Apollonius) of which only fragments have come down
to us. Seneca the Elder (Controv. VII. 1, 27) quotes this verse
with the one before it, Desierant latrare canes urbesque silebant,
calling thern illos optimos versus Varronis. Cf. Apoll. Rhod. III.
749 seq. Vid. A. Riese, M. Ter. Varronis Sat. AIcnipp. Reliq.
p. 262.

7. suspensum . . . vestigium ponitur: zze. they wall< on tip-
toc as they approach the bedroom.
9. detinent: occupy ἥψω.- et . . . stationis paenitentia seces-

sisse: and in dis-satisfaction with our unlnclsgs and disayreeable post,
to have (jone into retirement.

11. si receptui cecinimus: if we have (really) sounded the retreat.

12. nec sese adhuc reduxit introrsus: and has not yet fallen
back upon its inner resourcca— erigitur: has its attention called
aside.— quod . . . curiosum facit: which makes him care (what
the uhcxpected may be).— Et me, quem dudum, ete: Aeneid,
II. 726—729, from the account of Aeneaa’s ssight, with his father
on his shouldcrs and his child beside him.
