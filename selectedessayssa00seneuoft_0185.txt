APOCOLOCYNTOSIS 145

Hades. Cf. Verg. Aen. VI. 264, umbrae silentes. Minos ac-
knmvledges himself outdone and will yicld you his place.—
causidici, venale genus: a reference not merely to their venality
in general but to the special fact that Claudius had allowed them
to receive fces; ef. xii. 2. — poetae . . . novi: Claudius's willing-
ness to listen to an “author’s reading'’ is recallcd even by the
younger Pliny (Ep. I. 13. 3); contrast our author's attitude in
ii. 2.—concusso . . . fritillo: gambling was illegal; cf. Hor.
Carm. III. 24, 58, vetita leqzssbzzs alea. But Claudius was fond of
it and even wrote a book about the alcatory art. Note his penalty
in Apoc. xivfxv.

XIII. 1. Talthybius: Agamemnon’s herald in the Trojan &Van
and proverbial for a swift and zealous messenger. The Talthybius
os [he gyods was evidently Mercury. — inter Tiberim et viam Tectam:
at the northern end of the Campus Martius, not far from the
mausoleum of Augustus, where Claudius's ashes were actually
laid away, the via Tecta (cf. Martial, VIII. 75, 2; III. 5, 5.),
which was perhaps the via Fornicata of Livy (XXII. 36), seems
to have been a sort of arcade with shops. Claudius's descent to
Hades here is apparently due to the popular superstitious that
centred about this campus iqmser, as about Avernus (cf. Verg.
Aen. VI. 240); in primitive times a pool fed by hot springs and
other signs of voleanic action had marked the spot, the Terentum
of the Ludi Terentini or Ludi Saeculares, sor which Horace wrote
the Carmen Saeculare in Augustus's time (13.0. 17). Claudius
himself had celebrated the games here in 47 Α.1)., by a different
computation of the century date from Augustus’s (800 A.U.c.),
and incur-red some ridicule for the traditional announcement of a
celebration such as no man then living had seen or would see again,
when Augustus's games had taken place only sixty-three years
before and one of the actors appeared in both (Pliny, N. H. VII.
159). The altar of Dis and Proserpina and other inscriptional
evidence on the saecular games was discovered here in 1886 and
subsequently (see Lanciani, Ru'z'ns and Ercavations, p. 446).

2. compendiaria: sc. vm,- i.e. by α short eut. Cf. Ep. 73, 12;
te in caelum compendiario voco. —- Narcissus libertus: one of the
most wealthy and powcrful of Claudius's freedmen, and his secre-
tary ab epi-stuli& ie. in charge of his correspondence. He was
