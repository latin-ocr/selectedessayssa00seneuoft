APOCOLOCYNTOSIS 131

easy sympathy.—-Febris: apparently the well-known Roman
sever, according to the officially reported cause of Claudius's
death. As a goddess she had a sanctuary on the Palatine. ——
ceteros . . . reliquerat: perhaps in compliment to the new
regime. But they presently appear to be in heaven. —Ego tibi
dico: note the vulgar emphasis—tot annis: apparently the
ablative of time instead of the accusative of duration was com-
moner in the sermo vulqaris than in literature. It is usual on
plebeian tombstones. That Fever's constancy had early under-
mined Claudius's health is recorded by Suetonius (Claud. 2 and 31).
—Luguduni natus: cf. Suet. Claud. 2 and Dio, LIV. 36. The
campaign against the Germans had called Claudius's parents,
Drusus and Antonia, to the north, 10 Rc. —Marci municipem:
the text here is doubtful. The name Planci, from L. Munatius
Plancus, one of the founders in 43 Rc. of the Roman colony at
Lugudunum, has been substituted by some editors for Illarci.
Mark Antony the triumvir has been suggested, coins bearing his
name having been struck at Lugudunum while he had the govern-

an allusion to the historic capture by Brennus. — ego tibi recipio:
Iassure ιηοω like the Greek ἀναδέχομαι, Ι take the responsibilztty
for the statement. — Licinus: a native Gaul, a slave and freed-

man of Julius Caesar, and by Augustus appointed procurator
(cf. reqnavit) of Gallia Lugudunensis, wherc he was notorious for
his extortion and tyranny. His name became proverbial for a
rich parvenu; cf. Sen. Ep. 119, 9; Persius, ii. 36,· Juv. i. 109
and xiv. 306; Martial, VIII. 3, 6, etc. — multis annis: cf. tot annis
above—plura loca calcasti: ef. v. 3, Herculem qui . . . perer-
raverat. Hercules was a famous knight errant. calcasti: have
tramped. Bucheler, however, thinks that tu autem means Claudius,
referring to his expedition to Britain. — perpetuarius: wanderivq.
