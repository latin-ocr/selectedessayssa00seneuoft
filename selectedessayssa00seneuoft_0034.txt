characteristic peculiarities of Seneca's style were espe-
cially of another sort, due to his constant effort after a
concise, antithetic brilliancy. Some of them, if we apply
the Spencerian test of economy of attention, are such as
tend to facilitate the reader⁷s apprehension of the thought;
others retard it. The habit of antithesis is certainly one
of the former, however it may be in danger of meriting
Gellius’s stricturesss‘ It- stimulates the reader's attention
and helps his mental arrangement of the ideas. The
effort after variety with conciseness‚ however, often is
