AD LUCILIUM EPISTULA CXV 205

from justice.— et magistratus . . . facit: according to the re-
quirements of the census, that a man must have a prescribed
amount of property to be eligible to senatorial offices. — ex quo:
sc. tempore ,· equiv. to postquam. — honor: i.e. aestimatio. — mer-
catores et venales in vicem: purchasers and purchasable by turns.

11. nobis . . . fecerunt: have implanted in its—convenit:
are aqreed ; personal, a rare. use of the word. — hoc dis . . . con-
secrant: Persius in his second satire (vss. 55 seq.) amplifies this
same thought.

12. adfectibus . . . facem subdant: i.e. both kindle and in-
tensify the heat of our impulses.

13. Regia SoliS‚ etc.: quoted, as a specimen, from Ovid’s
account of how Phaethon went to the palace of the sun-god, his
father, and essayed to drive his chariot (Metam. II. 1-2).—
Aureus axis, etc.: ibid. II. 107—108.

14. Sine me, etc.: These first seven lines, which are trans-
lated, very likely by Seneca himself, into Latin senarii, are from
unknown sources. The original Greek form has been preserved
only in the case of the first line, as follows, ἔα με κερδαίνοντα κεκλῆσθαι
κακόν, which occurs as part of a longer fragment. Vid. A.
Nauck, Traqicorum Graecorum Fragmenta, Frag. adespota, 181
(2d ed.); also ibid. Frag. 461. — An dives, etc.: sc. sit aliquis.—
Non quare et unde: cf. Juv. Sat. xiv. 207, Unde habeas quaerit

nenia—tanti . . . fuit: was “worth'' as much—Pecunia, in- ἢ

gens, etc.: the following five verses are a translated fragment
from Euripides's lost tragedy of Danae, in whose story a shower
of gold figures conspicuously. They are given in the Greek form
by Stobaeus (Flor. 91, 4) and others. Cf. 'Nauck, Euripidis
Perditarum Trayoedz'arum Fraqmenta, 2d ed., Frag. 326.

15. hi novissimi versus: these last five— exspectarent: i.e.
await the deuouement.— Dabat . . . Bellerophontes, etc.: Bel-
lerophontes in that story was payiny the penalty which every man
pays in his own <life history). Apparently Seneca has fallen into
¹ the error of thinking his quotation was from the play called Bel-
lerophontes, by the same author, from which perhaps some of the
other quotations (not hi novissimi) may have been taken. Bel-
lerophontes ultimately comes in the story to poverty and
wretchedness.
