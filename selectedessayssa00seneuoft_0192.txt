who had of tener encountered free speech on his part than servility''
(Tac. Ann. XV. 61). Μ616 decency, in a published work ad-
dressed 10 the head of the government, required an attitude that
under different circumstances would have been less appropriate;
and there was ample reason to suppose that the best way to make
Nero's stood impulses settle into principle was to single them out
for cmnpliment. Furtheimore, when Seneca recognized that
vanity was a large force in Nero's character, it was hardly less than
a duty to seek to make it effective as a restraint and stimulus
on the side of good gover1nnent.¹

In the rhetorical sense the Dc Clementia is one of Seneca's
finest works. But as we have it, it is incomplete. Originally it
was written in three books, corresponding presumably to the
111100. divis-hius of the subject as it is outlined in chapter iii. 1.
Of these we have only the first· book and seven Chapters of the
second, 110110 of the rest remaining but a few quoted fragments.

The best source of the. text is a Vatican manuscript (Laure-
slzamensis S. Nazarii, now No. 1547 111 the Palatine collection of
the Vatican library) of about the ninth century. In this the
De Clementia is preserved along with the De Beneficiis, with which
it occurs in several other manuscripts also.

BOOK I

I. I write of clemency to you, Nero, that you may realize your
qualities and understand the greatnesspf your part in the world.
It is a high standard of generosity which you have set yourself,
but inen’s doubts of you have disappeared‚ and all regard you
as the pattern of your own future action.

¹ There is a curious parallel in the Octavia, vss. 438—592, where Seneca·
is represented in conversation with Nero as appealing to the same
motives that arc. suggested in 1116 De Clementia. In a different way ‘the
present essay throughout offers many paralle¹s to the De Ira, naturally,
since auger and clemency are so often opposed.
