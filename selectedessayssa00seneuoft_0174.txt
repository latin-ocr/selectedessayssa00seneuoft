evidently a gap of at least one leaf in the archetype from which
they are all derived.

VIII. 1. Non mirum quod . . . fecisti: the changed situation
indicates something of what must have intcrvcned. One 01 the
members of the Olympian assembly, which seems to be organized
31101- the pattern 01 1110 Roman senate, is speaking, presumably
to Hercules, whom (313υᾴ133033 indueed to be his advocate.
The unsophistieated champion has brought his protege into'the
curia and stated his desire that he be admitted into the cele-stial
fellowship. He is met with some unparliamentary reproaches,

Ἐπικούρειος θεὸς, ete: he cannot be an Epicurean qod (who) neither
has (my bothfer himself nor occasions (my to other& Claudius would
be excluded by either speeifieation. The phraseology of the defi-
nition may be variously paralleled, ey. in Cicero, de N.D. I.
17, 45; cf. id. de Off. III. 28.—“rotundus⁷' . . . ut ait Varro,
ctc.: very likely in one 01 his Saturae Menippeae (01. Bucheler,
Varronis IlIcnipp. Reliq. 583). The words would fit the iambic

this much of simplification at least. The words were morc or less

instances in Petron. 59 and 63, and Mart. VII. 78, 4.
