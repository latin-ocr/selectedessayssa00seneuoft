have chosen to explain the word Apocolocyrztosis differently, ,tia
reference to a drug by which Claudius met his death, takifidg
to suggest the consequences of a dose of coloeynth (κολοι In
Lat. colocynthis; Fr. coloquinte). One or two symptoms the
are recorded of Claudius’s dying hours tend to support this vie..
but the other interpretation of the title is the more generally
accepted. It is possible, however, that Dio's tradition is inaccu-
rate, and that an allusion to the pumpkin head which he asso-
ciates with Seneca’s satire really belonged to something else, or
was, perhaps, a mere conversational epithet. There is a possi-
bility also that the missing reference to the vegetable, which would
explain Dio's title, was to be found at the end of the satire, which
on account of the abruptness of the present conclusion some
critics have thought-*to be lost, or in the undoubted lacuna before
the eighth chapter, though it is by no means evident how the
κολοκύντη could have been brought plausibly in; or else we may
assume that the name, “Immortalization as a Pumpkin Head ''
was intended simply to ha'ye a sugges ive app lca lon to t e whole
subject, like the titles of some modern novels. The piece appears
to have been hastily written, in view of some minor discrepaneies
noted later.

The chief authorities for the life of Claudius are Suetonius
(Vita Divi Claudii), Tacitus (Annales, Books XI.—X11.), and Dio
Cassius (Book LX). Claudius was the brother of Germanicus
and hence the uncle of Gaius (Caligula), his predecessor. He had
been an unhealthy, awkward boy, kept in the background all his
early life by the heads of the family, amusing himself by dabbling
in scholarship and other less creditable pastimes, when at the
age of fifty, almost by accident, he was brought to the throne
left vacant by Caligula’s assassination. His reign of thirteen years
was not without its merits. He was inclined to be conscientious
and painstaking. But in many ways he was incpt and ccecntric,²
