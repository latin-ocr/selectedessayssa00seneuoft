Julius Caesar in the Pro sslarcello, v. 13: amplissimos viros . . .

the sister of Sallust the historian, and his heir, was at first an

M. Valerius Messala Corvinus, the famous orator, was among those
proscribed by Antony, but fied to the camp of Brutus and Cas—

himself by going over to Antony and Octavius. He was highly
favored by Augustus. Cf. Apoc. x. 2.—Asinios: C. Asinius
