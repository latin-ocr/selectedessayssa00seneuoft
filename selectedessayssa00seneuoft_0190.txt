150 NOTES, CAP. X V

Claudius is thus not only lest as the slave os a freedmanâ€š but is
condemned to a life of legal drudgery (and a laborem inritum) quite
in accordance with his habit. He is abruptly saved from even the
parody of an heroic punishment, and relegated, with eonscious
anticlimax and contemptuous haste, to something like hjs appro-
priate destiny.
