THE sTYLE OF SENEQ-x’s WRITINGS XXV

worthless writer, whose books it is not in the least worth
while to take up, because his diction seems common and
hackneyed, his matter and sentiments either of a foolish
and superficial vehemence, or, as it were, 01 3 frivolous
and sels-assertive cleverness, and his learning limited and
popular, having nothing either 01 grace or 01 dignity 110111

that there is too little elegance in his words, yet maintain
that >he has no lack 01 knowledge and learning of the sul)-

are not so helpful to the developing'character 01 young
men (adulescentium indolem) as the bad things are
injurious. ,

In estimating Gellius’s opinion we bear in mind that it
is that 01 3 very limited man who was notoriously fond 01
old-fashioned tendencies in preference to those 01 3 more
recent day. But Gellius’s contemporary Fronto, another
teacher 01 rhetoric like Quintilian, is even more severe in
condemnation 01 Seneca's “ modulated, dancing, jingling''
