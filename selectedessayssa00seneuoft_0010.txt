torical thread. The Epistulae Illorales are generally recog-
nized as among Seneca’s finest literar-y work3 they certainly
show his power of moral analysis at its best, and they help
to reveal the intellectual background of his public life.

The text here given, with very few changes, which are
listed at the end of the volume, is that of the current
Teubner editions including the essay Aa Polybium (Ie Con-
solatione by Hermes, the De Clementia. by Hosius, ancl the
Epistulae by Hense, and of the WVeidmann edition of the
Apocolocyntosis by Bucheler.

My thanks are due to the Columbia University Press for
courteous permission to reproduce, at some points in the
notes on the A),›ocoloeyntosi3‚ phraseology which had already
been used in my more extended study of the same work
published by the Press.

In particular Ι wish to express my obligations to Pro-
fessor Egbert, Editor-in-chief of the present series,¹ for his
helpful counsel, and to Professor August Rupp of the Co]—
lege of the City of New York, who has very generously
aided in reading the proof of the book, and made valuable

suggestions.
