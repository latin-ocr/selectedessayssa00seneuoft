140 NoTEs CAP. x-xi

verse sensitiveness to her personal grief when Marcellus died (cf.
consol. ad filare. ii.); there may have been something in that
incident to which her brother alludes. Or possibly Octavia, who
was Claudius-'s maternal grandmother, had been less pessimistie
as to his youthful capabilities than had Augustus and Livia (cf.
Suet. Claud. 3-4>.

4. sub meo nomine latens: as all the emperors took the name of
Augustus, Claudius in particular used commonly to take oath per
Auyastum (Suet. Claud. 11). — duas Iulias: both were the victims
of Messalina’s machinations. It was Julia Livilla (daughter of
Germanicus, the adopted son of Tiberius), with whom Seneca was
involved in the charge which caused his banishment as well as her
own, in which she perished (fame occisa). The other Julia was
the daughter of T iberius's son Drusus. — abnepotem L. Silanum:

Jupiter’s. — Dive Claudi: es. ix. 2, illo dim isso. — antequam . .
cognosceres: Claudius was said to have been capriciously hasty
and unfair in his condelnnati01is; cf. xii. 3, una tantum parte
audita, and xiv. 2—3‚ similarly, also Suet. Claud. 15 and 29, and
Dio, LX. 14—16.

XI. 1. quem ῥῖψε, etc.: whom, snatchinq him by the soot, he
