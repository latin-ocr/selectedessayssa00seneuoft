xxii INTRODUCTION

Of the works included in the present volume, the Con-
solatio ad Polybium represents the part of Seneca's life
when he was in exile, which, though he was nearly fifty
years old, was early in his strictly literary career ; the
Apocolocyntoszfs and the essay on Clemency express two
diverse aspects of his mind in the early part of the reign
of Nero; the Letters for the most part at least were written l
when Seneca was old and out of favor. The Apocolo- f
cyntosis is closely related to Seneca⁷s attitude toward the l,
two emperors, Claudius and Nero. The Consolatio ad
Polybium belongs among his reactions to the former.
The De Clementia is an important appeal to what seemed ί
the best side of Nero’s character and typically represents
Seneca⁷s attitude toward him. The Letters which have
been selected supplement the view of Seneca’s personal
relations to history, not so much by the addition of spe-
cific facts as hy throwing light upon some of the complex-
ities of his character, amid the difficulties of being both a
man of the world and an experimental moralist.. Epistle l
73, in particular, is his exposition of the attitude of phi- ¹
losophy toward the imperial government.

IV. THE STYLE OF SENECA'S WRITINGS

Seneca's literary style is one of the types of Silver Age
Latinity which severer classicists from the days of Quin· ἓ
tilian onwards have united to condemn. Reactionary
critics of the age that shortly followed his own regarded ¹
Seneca as modern and decadent. But however truly he may j
be “of the second rank as a classic '' 1 in the strict sense of

¹ Mackail, Latin Liternum-e, p. 171. Seneca himself says, apropos of a ἶ
change os diction that he noticed in his own day, olim cum latine loquere- ¹

mur (Ep. 39, 1). l
