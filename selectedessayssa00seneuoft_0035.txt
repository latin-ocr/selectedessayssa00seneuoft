THE STYLE OF SENECA’S WRITINGS XXXi

tendency to throw the reader from the track.l His in-
dulgence in zeugma is another natural result of his love
for conciseness. An occasional vagueness is caused, too,
by peculiarities in the use os demonstrative pronouns‚ and
particularly the omission of them when a more “ classical ”
writer, less afraid ot being too obvious, would have put,
them in; so also by the illegitimate allusion to something
as if it had been already introduced when it has not been.
Such instances as hanc . . . multitudinem and hoc iuqum,
in the beginning of the De Clementia, have a parallel in
certain modern vulgar colloquial usages, and ma)v have
appeared in Seneca. from a similar source. The frequent,
use of substantive infinitives seems also to show something
of the colloquial tendency which Seneca frankly avowed
in his epistles. It is found in other Silver Age writers
with the same bent in this direction.

YVhatever may be said of Seneca's ordinary Latin style,
that of the satire on the deification of Claudius obviously
departs much farther from the classical literary standards.
It- happens to be the only ancient Latin specimen which is
extant, in an}v completeness, of the so-called Menippean
satire,2 a literary genre which owes its name to the Cynic
philosopher Menippus of Gadara, and was introduced
into Latin literature by the antiquar& Varro. Its formal
characteristic is its irregular mixture ot prose and verse,
with a tendency to parody; and in style it affected a racy
homeliness of manner, which is well exemplified in the
Apocolocyntosz’s. Written 111 a vein of broad burlesque,
this is full of the jocularities of colloquial phraseology,

¹ Cf. De Clementia, I. iii. 3 and xz. 2, and notes.

² This character, however, is often ascribed to the satir-icon of Pe-
tronius; and several specimens were produced by scholars of the Renais-
sance.
