APOCOLOCYNTOSIS 125

d he was notoriously under the (lomination of his freedmen and
wives, particularly Valeria Messalina, his third wife, whose
.1ti0us intrigues were the scandal of Rome, and Agrippina, his
e and fourth wife, the mother of Nero by a former husband.

The actual death of Claudius was caused by his eating of poi-

soned mushrooms provided for him by Agrippina’s orders, and was
hastened, it is said, by her officious physieian, who under prc-
tence of medical treatment really applied more poison. The story
officially given out was that Claudius had died of a sever. He was
deified‚ the first emperor since Augustus to receive this honory by
senatorial dec-ree. The customary official eulogium was pro-
nounced by Nero, but it was written by Seneca, who seems to
have consoled himself shortly afterward, very likely at the Satur-
nalia which came only a few weeks later, by producing the present
skit. This was probably designed for private reading in the
imperial circle; Seneca’s dislike of Claudius was well known,¹ and
. Nero and his mother, however prudently they attended to Clau-
dius's deification‚ were under no illusions as to his divinity. In fact,
the emperor who had been spared by his predecessor as a butt
for ridicule,² was also, we are told, deified as a jol«) ³ by his youth-
ful successor. To the latter, evidently, the damaging implicatione
of Seneea¹s satire concerning the whole doctrine of the imperial
apotheosis were without offenee.

1. 1. ante diem ΙΙΙ. id. Oct.: the date of Claudius's death as
given by Suetonius (Claud. 45), Tacitus (Ami. XII. 69), and Dio
(LX. 34). Mention of the year is unneeessary, the satire was
composed so soon after the event. —- anno novo: not in the ordi-
nary sense, but like the following initio saeculi, of the happy
beginning of Nero’s reign. —nec offensae nec gratiae: isse. the

Claudius's policy in punishing crime. The other is in the De Beneficiis
(I. xv. 5), where Seneca quotes with approval a remark of Crispus
Passienus, Malo Divi Auyusti iudicium, malo Claudii beneficium, an evi-
dent reflection upon the reliability of Claudius’s judgment.
