xxviii INTRODUCTION

His expressed ideas on the subject of style ¹ often seem
as inconsistent as some aspects of his life and his philos-
ophy. His literary principles are apparently at variance
with each other and with his own usage. At one time he
seems to be disparaging oareful literary art as unworthy
of a philosopher: oratio sollicita philosophum non decet‚2
he says, and even, quis enim accurate loquitur nisi qm:
vult putide (ie. with disgusting affectation) loqui:23 At
another time he blames a lack of deliberation and order-
liness‚ and urges that the manner should be as dignified
as the matter. ⁴Hoc non EQ, he sayS, speaking of im-
petuous unconsidered fluency in a lecturer, in philosopho,
cuius pronuntiatio quoquc, sicut vita, debet esse composita*
—- his delivery ought to be as carefully ordered as his life.
In another place, quoting the proverb, talis hominibus fuit
oratio qualis vita, he compares the slovenly literary style of
Maecenas to his negligent manner of dress and behavior:
non oratio eius aeque soluta est, quani ipse discinctus ? 5 The
whole epistle in which this occurs is devoted to an interest-
ing discussion of the influences which go to produce faults

be viewed as a necessary practical precaution or as a fault in the taste of
the time; it was evidently both, at any rate it may be well studied in
Seneca, in whom it is not so gross as in some writers and whose ex-
hibitions of it are ingeniously tempered and deflected by the philosophie
ideals which we might wish had prevented it altogether. Cf. Nat.
Quaest. 1V., Pracs. 9: eo enim iam dementiae venimus, ut qui parce
adulatur, pro malzssyno sit. It may be that even the details of Seneca’s
literary style. were affected for the worse when he was trying to appeal
to Nero’s meretricious theatrical tastes. It was charged by Seneca’s
enemies that he wrote more poetry as Nero developed a fondness for it.
