146 NOTES‚ eAP. XIII-XIV

perhaps the Narcissus named by St. Paul (Ep. ad Rom. xvi. 11).
Since he was an opponent of Agrippina, Claudius’s assassination
was aeeomplished while he was away at the watering place of
Sinuessa in Campania for his gout. After Claudius’s death,
Narcissus was summarily disposed of, and got to Hades, since
hc did not go by way of Olympus, aliead of his patron.—

venienti: sc. Claudio, patrono—erat (tle. veniebat) a balineo:
the baths of Sinuessa. —quid di: sc. veniunt? In the mime of

Herodas entitled The sslatclzmalser occurs the line (9) τί σὺ θεὸς πρὸς
ἀνθρώπους, where it evidently, from the context, means, It is a long
time since Ι have seen you; your visits are as rare as those of a
god among men. Perhaps Seneca was adapting the quotation. —
Celerius: hurry up! for the use of the comparative, cf. citius,
vii. 1. —Dicto citius: a phrase familiar enough for burlesque;
cf. Verg. Aen. I. 142.

3. proclivia . . . facile descenditur: a reminiscenee of the
familiar facilis descensus Averno (Aen. VI. 126); but the senti-
ment is common. —— ad ianuam Ditis: cf. Vei-g. Aen. VI. 127, 011
the entrance to Pluto's palaee. — ut ait Horatius: Carm. II. 13, 34.
—belua centiceps: Vergil's account (Aen. VI. aim—423), which
gives Cerberus three heads instead of a hundred, is more familiar.
Hesiod, however, gives him fifty (Theogy. 312). -— subalbam canem
in deliciis: a white doq as α pc& subalbus is strictly “whitishff’ —
sane non quem, eto: really not one that you would like to meet in
the dark. There is evidently a play also on the two meanings of
tenebris.

4. procedunt cantantes: Μ. the crowd in Hades. -εὑρήκαμεν,
συγχαίρομεν; we have found haim and wc rejoztcoe the ritualistic ac-
clamation of Osiris in the annual Egyptian festival of his return ;
the cry to which Juvenal refers in Sat. viii. 29, “what the people
shout when Osiris is found.’' It is also said to have been the
formula of rejoicing when a new Apis, the bull incarnation of
Osiris, was found after the old one had died. Its present applica-
tion indicates that the souls of Claudius's victims had been wait-
ing for him. — C. Silius: calleci by Tacitus (Arm. XI. 12) ‘im-en-
tutis Romanae pulcherrimum, and chiefly noted as the paramour cf
Messalina, whose mock marriage with him was the occasion of
her condemnation. — Iuncus Vergilianus, Traulus Montanus, and
