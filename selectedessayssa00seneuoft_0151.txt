AD POLYBIUM DE CONSOLATIONE 111

1. numen: i.e. Caesar. —i11a: tristitia.

2. non est quod: lit. there is no reason why. —patiarisz sub-
junctive of characteristic. —- antistitem: as Horace called himself
“priest of the Muses'' (Carm. ΙΙΙ. 1, 3).-vindicent: as in the
familiar legal phrase, vindicare in libertatem, to liberate. — Homerus
et Vergilius, whom Polybius apparently had translated, the one
into Latin, the other into Greek. Cf. xi. 5. —- pluribus notos, etc.:
known to more than the‘y had written sor. —opera: res qestas. —-

domestico . . . praeconio: i.e. by a “press bureau” in his own
household. —materiamz especially his expeditions to Germany
and Britain—exemplum: Claudius’s own literary work; par-

ticularly his histories; cf. Apoc. v. 4, and note.

3. Aesopeos logos: note the Latinized Greek word. Aesop’s
Fables were adapted into Latin by Phaedrus, who flourished
under Tiberius, so that the author's reference to such a work as
an intemptatum . . . opus has given the critics difficulty. Ap-
parently Seneca was ignorant of Phaedrus, or ignored him to
compliment Polybius, who had shown a taste for this sort of
adaptation. -hilariora studia: i.e. of light literature. —habetoz
observe the force os the tense. — conroborati eius: sc. animi. —
solutiora: more jovial.

4. In illis: i.e. severioribus scriptis. —avoeabit, etc.: the very
sternness of the subjects which it treats will distract the mind (eum)
however morbid and reluctant it still is. — haec: object of seret. —
sibi . . . constiterit: it has been restored to equanimity.

IX. Mourning, if on your brother’s account, is needless, since
he is now either free from all sense of loss or else is actually happier
than when on earth.

1. meo nomine: on my own account. —— perit indulgentiae iacta-

tio: the display of tender feelinq is lost, i.e. is not real. -ineipitz
with complementary infin. desciscere, modified by cum . . . re-
spicit. — hoc uno excusatus, ete: is a generalization. — a pietate

desciscere: i.e. ceases to be a matter of dutiful affection. — nihil,
ponere: subjects of convenit. —calculos ponere: to set counters
(on a counting board), i.e. to make a calculation of profit and
loss in mourning for a brother.

2. alterutrum . . . iudicem: that I should choose one os these
alternative views. Is Seneca's logie satisfactory?
