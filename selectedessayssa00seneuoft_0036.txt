xxxii INTRODUCTION

popular proverbs, words of more or less distinctly plebeian
formation and use, vulgar tautologies, and occasionally
downright slang, variously grouped for cumulative effect.
Even its syntax has leanings in the same direction. In
turns of phrase, however, and tricks of style, it has marked
resemblances to Seneca's more serious works ; and though
in its general character it is strikingly different from them}
it 15 reasonably to be considered as the product of a Stoic
philosopher turned Cynic (like Menippus) on a Saturna-
lian holiday for the amusement, none too good-natured, of
himself and his friends.

V. EDITIONS AND WORKS FOR REFERENCE

The editio princeps ¹ of Seneca was published at Naples in 1475.
It contains some spurious works, and some works of Seneca the
Eldcr, as well as most of those extant by Seneca the Philosopher‚
including the Consolatio ad Polybium, the De Clementia, and the
Ep‘z‘stles, but not the Apocolocyntosis, which did not appear in
print until 1513. The editio princeps of this is entitled Lucii
Annaei Senecae in morte Claudii Caesaris Ludus nuper repertus,
Romae, MDXIII.

There is a long line of later editions, conspicuous among them
being those associated with the names of the great editors, Eras-
mus (first edition, Basle, 1515), and Justus Lipsius (first edition,
Antwerp, 1605).

Some interest attaches to the fact that John Calvin‚ the pre-
destinarian theologian, in his student days, edited the De Cle-
mentia (Paris, 1532); Jean J aeques Rousseau published a trans—
lation of the Apocolocyntosis (included in his IVorks, vol. ii.,
Geneva, 1781).

More recent editions of Seneca’s (prose) writings are by the
following: —-

F. Ε. 111111κορῖ (Worlss, with critical notes and commentary‚
5 1’()15., Leipzig. 1797—1811).
